# ArTX mobile app

Connects street artists in Austin, TX (“ATX”) with fans, and potential clients interested in commissioning original murals. The project is inspired by the [clickable prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d0fec993-89bb-4a7f-b98e-7d6e63b4f987-85ad/?fullscreen) my team created during the Adobe/General Assembly Creative Jam, a 70-hour design challenge in August 2020.
